## Opereto AWS services

This package is a wrapper to several operations (as listed bellow) that are commonly used by opereto users maintaining a continuous testing ecosystem in AWS cloud environment. AWS provides a comprehensive set of API calls allowing to manage every resource and perform any operation available. In case you need additional devops operations, we recommend wrapping one of the many third-party libraries or command line toos available in the market and build your own opereto services based on those tools.
See all services in the /services directory.
